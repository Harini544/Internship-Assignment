    <p>Node.js (Node)

        What is Node.js (Node)?
        Node.js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. 
        Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use 
        JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.
        Node is sometimes referred to as a programming language or software development framework, 
        but neither is true;, it is strictly a JavaScript runtime.
        
        Node incorporates the V8 JavaScript engine, the same one used in Google Chrome and other browsers.
        It is written in C++ and can run on macOS, Linux, Windows and other systems. The engine parses and executes JavaScript code. 
        It can operate independently of a browser environment, either embedded in a C++ application or implemented as a standalone program.
        The V8 engine compiles JavaScript internally, using just-in-time (JIT) processes to speed up execution.
